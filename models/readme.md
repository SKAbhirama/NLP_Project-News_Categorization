# Models:

## This folder contains the codes we used for the main models in our project, namely:
- 'Naive Bayes': Naive Bayes is a probabilistic algorithm based on Bayes' theorem. It assumes feature independence, making it efficient for text classification and spam filtering. It's simple and fast.
- 'SVM': SVM is a powerful supervised learning algorithm for classification and regression tasks. It finds optimal hyperplanes to separate data into distinct classes, achieving high accuracy in complex datasets.
- 'Random Forest': Random Forest is an ensemble learning method using multiple decision trees. It improves accuracy and reduces overfitting by combining diverse models. It's robust, handles missing data well, and is widely used for classification and regression.
### The final model we chose was Random Forest based on the overall accuracy and precision.
