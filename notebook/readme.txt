This folder contains the notebook with our codes for our model to categorise news.
We tried a lot of ways to create this model, trying different methods and features to create the most accurate model.
After many trial and errors, we found this code to be the best result yielding, where we used a TF-IDF matrix to extract features and the RandomForest Classifier to train and test our model.
It also contains all the separate codes for each and every step included in the main project.
