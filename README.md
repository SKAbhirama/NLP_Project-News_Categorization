# News Categorization Project

## Overview
This repository contains code and resources for a news categorization project. The goal of the project is to categorize news articles into different types based on their content. The project utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, machine learning algorithms, and other tools to achieve accurate categorization.

## Project Structure
- `data/`: Folder containing the dataset used for training and testing.
- `notebooks/`: Colab notebooks used for data exploration, preprocessing, and model training.
- `models/`: Saved machine learning models.
- `dependencies.md`: List of dependencies for the project.

## Usage
- Follow the steps outlined in the notebooks to preprocess data and train the model.
- Open the datasets foldeer to find the input data we used for this project.
- Explore the models/ directory for pre-trained models that can be used for inference.

## Acknowledgments
We used an "inshorts-english-news-dataset" found on Kaggle, containing all the data we required for the model: the news headlines, news content and their respective categories.
